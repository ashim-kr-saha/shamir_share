# Zeroize Integration Summary

This document summarizes the integration of the `zeroize` crate into the Shamir's Secret Sharing library to securely wipe sensitive data structures from memory when they are dropped.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependency Addition
- Added `zeroize = { version = "1.7", features = ["zeroize_derive"], optional = true }` to `Cargo.toml`
- Made the dependency optional with a feature flag
- Added `zeroize` to the default features

### 2. Applied Zeroize Traits

#### `Share` struct (`src/shamir.rs`)
- Applied `#[cfg_attr(feature = "zeroize", derive(Zeroize, ZeroizeOnDrop))]`
- The `ZeroizeOnDrop` trait automatically ensures the struct's contents are wiped when dropped
- Contains sensitive share data (`data: Vec<u8>`) derived from the secret

#### `Dealer` struct (`src/shamir.rs`)
- Applied `#[cfg_attr(feature = "zeroize", derive(Zeroize, ZeroizeOnDrop))]`
- Contains sensitive data:
  - `data: Vec<u8>` - the original secret with optional integrity hash
  - `coefficients: Vec<u8>` - pre-computed polynomial coefficients

#### `FiniteField` struct (`src/finite_field.rs`)
- Applied `#[cfg_attr(feature = "zeroize", derive(Zeroize))]`
- Represents field elements used in cryptographic computations

### 3. Explicit Buffer Zeroization

#### `dealer()` method
- Zeroizes `data_to_split` and `coefficients` buffers before returning
- These contain the secret data and polynomial coefficients

#### `split_chunk()` method
- Zeroizes `random_data` buffer containing polynomial coefficients
- Called by both `split()` and `split_stream()` methods

#### `split_stream()` method
- Zeroizes sensitive buffers:
  - `chunk_read_buffer` - contains chunks of the original data
  - `chunk_with_hash_buffer` - contains data with integrity hash
  - `share_data_buffers` - contains computed share data

#### `reconstruct()` method
- Zeroizes `reconstructed_data` buffer before returning
- Contains the reconstructed secret data

#### `reconstruct_stream()` method
- Zeroizes sensitive buffers:
  - `share_chunk_data_buffers` - contains share data for reconstruction
  - `reconstructed_chunk_buffer` - contains reconstructed secret data

### 4. Feature Flag Implementation
- All zeroize functionality is conditionally compiled with `#[cfg(feature = "zeroize")]`
- Code compiles and works correctly both with and without the feature
- Used `#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "zeroize"), allow(unused_mut))]` to suppress warnings when zeroize is disabled

### 5. Testing
- Added `test_zeroize_feature_compilation()` to verify the feature compiles correctly
- Added `test_share_zeroize_on_drop()` to test manual and automatic zeroization
- All existing tests continue to pass with and without the zeroize feature

## Security Benefits

### Defense in Depth
- **Automatic Cleanup**: `ZeroizeOnDrop` ensures sensitive data is wiped when structs go out of scope
- **Explicit Cleanup**: Manual zeroization of temporary buffers prevents sensitive data from lingering in memory
- **Memory Dump Protection**: Reduces the window of opportunity for memory-dump attacks

### Sensitive Data Identified and Protected

1. **Share Data**: The actual share values derived from the secret
2. **Polynomial Coefficients**: Random values used to generate shares
3. **Original Secret Data**: The input data being protected
4. **Reconstruction Buffers**: Temporary data during secret reconstruction
5. **Finite Field Elements**: Individual field elements used in computations

## Usage

### With Zeroize (Default)
```toml
[dependencies]
shamir_share = "0.1.0"
```

### Without Zeroize
```toml
[dependencies]
shamir_share = { version = "0.1.0", default-features = false }
```

## Implementation Notes

- The integration maintains backward compatibility
- No performance impact when zeroize feature is disabled
- Minimal performance impact when enabled (only affects cleanup paths)
- All zeroization happens at the end of function scopes to avoid interfering with normal operations
- Uses conditional compilation to ensure zero overhead when the feature is disabled

## Verification

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
1. Code compiles correctly with and without the zeroize feature
2. All existing functionality continues to work
3. Zeroization actually occurs when expected
4. No performance regression in normal operation paths
