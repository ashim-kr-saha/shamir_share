## Interpreting the Results

### Performance Metrics Explanation

- **Time Range**: `[lower_bound median upper_bound]`
  - Lower bound: 95% confidence interval lower limit
  - Median: Middle value of all measurements
  - Upper bound: 95% confidence interval upper limit

- **Change**: Comparison with previous benchmark run
  - Shows percentage change in performance
  - `p-value` indicates statistical significance

- **Outliers**: Measurements that deviate significantly from the norm
  - High mild: Moderately slower than expected
  - High severe: Much slower than expected

### Key Insights from Sample Results

#### 1. Scaling Performance
```
Data Size    | Split Time | Throughput
10KB         | 46.1 µs    | ~217 MB/s
100KB        | 428.9 µs   | ~233 MB/s  
1MB          | 4.18 ms    | ~239 MB/s
```

**Analysis**: Good linear scaling with consistent throughput indicates efficient implementation.

#### 2. Streaming vs In-Memory Trade-off
```
Approach     | Time (100KB) | Overhead
In-Memory    | 405.1 µs     | Baseline
Streaming    | 452.3 µs     | +11.7%
```

**Analysis**: Streaming adds ~12% overhead, which is reasonable for the benefits:
- Constant memory usage
- Ability to process large files
- Better for real-time processing

#### 3. Optimal Chunk Size
```
Chunk Size   | Time        | Efficiency
1KB          | 518.7 µs    | Baseline
4KB          | 447.8 µs    | +13.7% faster
16KB         | 434.6 µs    | +16.2% faster
64KB         | 430.8 µs    | +16.9% faster
```

**Analysis**: Performance improves with larger chunks but plateaus around 16KB-64KB.

#### 4. Integrity Check Cost
```
Mode                    | Time      | Overhead
With integrity check    | 458.9 µs  | Baseline
Without integrity check | 393.1 µs  | +16.7% faster
```

**Analysis**: Integrity checking adds ~17% overhead, which is acceptable for the security benefit.

## Performance Targets Met

Based on these results, the implementation meets reasonable performance targets:

✅ **Throughput**: >200 MB/s across all data sizes
✅ **Streaming overhead**: <20% compared to in-memory
✅ **Scaling**: Linear performance scaling
✅ **Chunk optimization**: Clear performance improvement with larger chunks
✅ **Security cost**: Reasonable overhead for integrity checking

## Recommendations

1. **Default chunk size**: Use 16KB-64KB for optimal performance
2. **Use streaming for**: Files >1MB or when memory is constrained
3. **Use in-memory for**: Small files <100KB when memory is available
4. **Enable integrity checking**: Unless performance is absolutely critical
